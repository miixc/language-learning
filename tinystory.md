facing the sea in a warm spring
                    by haizi
as of tomorrow, to be a happy person
feeding horses, chopping woods,traveling the world.
as of tomorrow, to care about grains and vegetables
i have a house facing the sea in a warm spring.
as of tomorrow, to connect with every relatives
telling them my happiness
i'll tell everyone what the happy lightning has told to me.
give a warm names to every river and  mountain
strangers, best wishes to you too
wish you own a bright future
wish you meet the right person
wish you obtain happiness in the world
i just face the sea in a warm spring.
